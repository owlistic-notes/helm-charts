This repo contains helm charts the owlistic community developed to help deploy [Owlistic](https://github.com/owlistic-notes/owlistic) on Kubernetes cluster. It leverages the bjw-s [Common Library](https://bjw-s-labs.github.io/helm-charts/docs/common-library/) chart.

## Configuration

The chart is highly customizable. You can see a detailed documentation of all possible changes within the `charts/owlistic/values.yaml` file.

A complete list of possible values can be found in Common Library [values.yaml](https://github.com/bjw-s-labs/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/library/common/values.yaml)

## Install

```
$ helm install --create-namespace --namespace owlistic owlistic oci://ghcr.io/owlistic-notes/helm-charts/owlistic -f values.yaml
```

You should not copy the full values.yaml from this repository. Only set the values that you want to override.

There are a few things that you are required to configure in your values.yaml before installing the chart:
- You need to separately create a PVC for your data volume and configure `owlistic.persistence.data.existingClaim` to reference that PVC
- You need to make sure that Owlistic has access to a kafka and postgresql instance. Both can be enabled directly in the `values.yaml`, or by manually setting the `env` to point to an existing instance.

## Uninstall

To see the currently installed Owlistic chart:

```bash
helm ls --namespace owlistic
```

To uninstall/delete the `owlistic` chart:

```bash
helm delete --namespace owlistic owlistic
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
